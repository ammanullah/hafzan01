The market swings likely prompted many brokerage customer to scrutinize their advisers’ investments, and some might not have liked what they saw.\n “There\u0026rsquo;s a Warren Buffett quote: ‘Only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked,’” says Mark L. Egan, an assistant professor of finance at Harvard Business School. When they do find out, they often want to sue, but they can’t.\n Financial services companies require customers to waive their right to litigate and instead resolve their disputes through arbitration. Rather than argue before an impartial judge and jury, consumers must bring their grievances to an expert panel that’s more likely to take the brokerage’s side, reducing consumer awards by $40,000 on average, says HBS research.\n“Unlike judges, arbitrators aren’t randomly assigned,” Egan says. “The ones that are getting systematically selected [by the disputing parties] tend to be more industry friendly. This also incents arbitrators to slant their decisions in favor of the industry to increase their chance of being selected in the future.”\nBuilding on his 2018 research of 9,000 arbitration cases, Egan and fellow researchers found that 40 percent of arbitrators previously worked as advisers and they tended to favor brokers. The 8 percent of these arbitrators who were forced to pay clients restitution during their adviser careers were even more biased against consumers.\nEgan—along with Northwestern University Professor Gregor Matvos and Stanford University Professor Amit Seru—detail their findings in the revised working paper Arbitration with Uninformed Customers, released in May.\nBrokers’ critical advantages in arbitration About 40 percent of American investors rely on financial advisers to manage their portfolios in mostly productive relationships. However, every year, a few thousand customers file new arbitration cases with Finra, the US brokerage industry’s regulatory organization, alleging everything from negligence to fraud.\n “Consumers should monitor their investments and never assume that years of education will make them more aware of misdeeds.”\n During arbitration, claimants and brokerages rank their preferred arbitrators from a random Finra-generated list, striking ones that might side with the opposing party. Brokerages typically tap into vast troves of proprietary information about arbitrators’ past rulings, allowing them to eliminate arbitrators that might sympathize with customers.\nHowever, many consumers “have no idea who these arbitrators are. They’re just names on a list,” Egan says. “But the firms know each one of these arbitrators very well and have worked with them in the past.” While customers can access public information about brokers through Finra, they generally lack the time, resources, and expertise to harness the data. And even though most claimants hire lawyers to represent them in arbitration, brokerages still have the upper hand.\nThe degree to which a panel favors the defending company accounts for 24 percent of the variation in arbitration awards to consumers. In dollar terms, choosing an arbitrator who’s even slightly sympathetic to brokers—by one standard deviation more than average—cuts $21,000 from the median award of $175,000.\n “As soon as one party is substantially more informed than the other, it’s going to result in pretty unfair outcomes,” Egan says.\n More incentives that give brokers an edge Becoming an arbitrator—and earning as much as $2,900 during the average four-day case—can be an alluring way for an adviser to supplement their income. On an hourly basis, arbitrators make at least $75 an hour, almost twice as much as advisers’ $40 median hourly pay, according to Egan’s research.\nThe pressure to maintain a steady stream of cases further incents arbitrators to side with brokers. Arbitrators who seem lenient to advisers are 40 percent more likely to be picked. After all, ending up on a brokerage’s “strike” list can doom an arbitrator’s career.\n “Our estimates suggest that, ‘If I want to make a career out of this, I will make more money if I look industry-friendly,’” Egan says.\n To be sure, some arbitrators are more likely to support consumers, including the 11 percent of arbitrators who were previously fired as advisers by their firms. But these arbitrators are less likely to make the panel’s cut.\nThe proliferation of arbitration Companies from internet service providers to nursing home operators use arbitration to shield themselves from expensive, protracted lawsuits. Proponents say the approach resolves disputes faster than the court system and at lower cost. Critics say the process leaves consumers too vulnerable, especially when they’ve been physically harmed by a product or service.\nMany people don’t realize that they’re waiving their right to sue in a US court when they sign contracts or click “Agree” to a company’s terms of service. Arbitration becomes their only recourse to address grievances and the rulings are usually final and binding. An unhappy party can’t appeal the outcome.\nIn 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau tried to bar financial services companies from imposing “forced arbitration” on the roughly 20 million US households with brokerage accounts. However, Congress repealed the regulations shortly after they were introduced.\nFinra has considered measures to level the playing field, including letting parties eliminate more arbitrators and boosting arbitrators’ pay. Egan’s research suggests that those approaches tip the scales further toward brokerages, but simply providing a longer list of potential arbitrators could help more consumer-leaning arbitrators serve on panels.\nHow consumers can protect themselves Egan recommends two resources to consumers who find themselves in arbitration with a financial adviser:\n Finra’s BrokerCheck. This free, public database provides brokers’ work history and past violations—valuable clues that might signal the potential for bias. Arbitration experts. Attorneys and firms that specialize in brokerage arbitration are more likely to maintain their own arbitrator data.  Above all, consumers should monitor their investments and never assume that years of education will make them more aware of misdeeds. Egan started studying ethics in financial services after an adviser swindled his aunt, a high-level university administrator. Watching her seek restitution highlighted the vulnerability of all investors.\n “It was very powerful to see someone who’s very sophisticated still be taken advantage of,” he says. “If you think about how many people in the US lack financial knowledge, you can only imagine what could potentially be happening to them.”\n ","date":"25 Jan, 2021","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/hafzan01/images/post/03_hu2cddd1b819dc7bc54d031318ff6e8606_12397_545x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/hafzan01/images/post/03_hu2cddd1b819dc7bc54d031318ff6e8606_12397_600x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/hafzan01/images/post/03_hu2cddd1b819dc7bc54d031318ff6e8606_12397_700x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/hafzan01/images/post/03_hu2cddd1b819dc7bc54d031318ff6e8606_12397_1110x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"w-100 img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/hafzan01/images/post/03_hu2cddd1b819dc7bc54d031318ff6e8606_12397_1110x0_resize_q95_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"970\" height=\"500\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"https://ammanullah.github.io/hafzan01/blog/post-2/","tags":["research","financial advicers"],"title":"Why Investors Often Lose When They Sue Their Financial Adviser"},{"categories":["awarness"],"contents":"Government agencies are increasingly targets of cyberthreats as criminals try to steal or manipulate sensitive data.\nHaving a robust cybersecurity risk management plan is critical to helping your agency reduce exposure to threats. The key is to continually assess, refine and test your defense strategies. Even as threats evolve, there are four hallmark components that can serve as a foundation for your mitigation plans.\n1. Make cybersecurity a priority Managing cyber risk should be a priority for the highest levels of a government entity. The consequences of a breach—including those related to national security and election integrity—and the resource demands could be disastrous. Leaders should bring together the appropriate stakeholders to implement a holistic cyber risk management program.\n2. Secure the weakest link The weakest link in a cybersecurity chain is often the employee using a computer or mobile device connected to the organizational network. Regularly perform exercises with staff to keep them updated on cyberthreats and how they should respond.\nThe more regularly employees are tested, and the more robust their training, the more diligent they will be. Fraud awareness training for employees helped the Kentucky State Treasury team quickly stop a $5.3 million business email compromise scheme.\n3. Build a culture of cyber preparedness The Cybersecurity Capability Model (C2M2) is a tool to help organizations evaluate and improve their cybersecurity efforts.\nOne essential resource in this effort is the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The CSF and its affiliated self-assessment toolkit help organizations set benchmarks, identify priorities, implement risk management tactics, measure improvement and adopt appropriate changes. Using this approach, government entities can help drive their preparedness to a level that can meet the current threat landscape.\n4. Enlist third-party expertise Government entities—particularly at the state and local level—may not always have sufficient in-house resources or budgeting to fully implement cybersecurity tactics. Supplementing your operations with third parties can help provide added security capabilities. Should a breach occur, third parties can:\nFinancial institutions typically have insights, tools and the experience to help protect your online systems and other networks from cyberattacks. Whenever possible, lean on your financial partners to help provide education and awareness training, share best practices and mitigation strategies—or to test your organization’s cybersecurity preparedness.\n","date":"24 Jan, 2021","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/hafzan01/images/post/07_hu1380ebd894177d6b32b4792ca59955f3_91042_545x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/hafzan01/images/post/07_hu1380ebd894177d6b32b4792ca59955f3_91042_600x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/hafzan01/images/post/07_hu1380ebd894177d6b32b4792ca59955f3_91042_700x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/hafzan01/images/post/07_hu1380ebd894177d6b32b4792ca59955f3_91042_1110x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"w-100 img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/hafzan01/images/post/07_hu1380ebd894177d6b32b4792ca59955f3_91042_1110x0_resize_q95_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"https://ammanullah.github.io/hafzan01/blog/post-1/","tags":["cybersecurity"],"title":"4 ways the public sector can prevent cyberattacks"}]
